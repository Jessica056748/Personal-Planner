To Do List Editor
The to do list is a program that allows the user to create a To Do List where the user is able to either edit from a pre-existing to do list.
The user has multiple options to perform. The user is then able to add tasks that would include the name, completion status, urgency, category (work, school or personal) and due date of the task or update existing tasks. The user can then also
determine top 5 upcoming due dates for the day, top 5 upcoming due dates for a cateogry, the rate of completion for a due date, rate of completion in a category and recommendation of tasks to do next.
The user can also get a list of all tasks inputted as well as saving the to do list to work on later. When inputting the file used for saving or loading the to do list, it does not require the extension of the file as this is already accounted for in the program.
The to do list editor is used for to do list. It allows the user to visually see the to do list while adding
adding tasks. The user can either load a file or start a new one by pressing "Create New To Do List". This will ask the user
to add the current date to create a the to do list. After that, the user is able to add tasks to the list by inputting
the name, due date, selecting urgency if necessary and choosing a category for each task. The tasks will get
displayed on the right panel where user is able to modify due date, update the urgency and completion rate (from 1-5 where 1 is not completed
and 5 being completed).The red tasks indicate urgent tasks whereas the green tasks indicate completion. The calculation section of the editor allows user to do calculation on the informaton of the to do list where clicking on the type of calculation will display
all the possible ways of calculating the information which includes Top 5 upcoming due dates for the day, Top 5 upcoming due dates for the category, Rate
of completion for a due date, Rate of completion for a category and what to do next (based on urgency).
When the calculate button is pressed, it will display the necessary information for that type of calculation. The "View All" button
allows user to see all the tasks added by the user.
